#summary TextMate Oracle Bundle installation Guide.

= Installing =

Firstly, download the latest release from the [http://code.google.com/p/oracle-textmate-bundle/downloads/list Downloads page].  There is a link to this on the main [http://code.google.com/p/oracle-textmate-bundle/ project page], too.

Unzip this file (if you are using Safari, then this will probably have been done for you).

With !TextMate installed, you should be able to just double-click on the unzipped bundle and !TextMate will move it into your `~/Library/Application Support/TextMate` folder and it will appear in the Bundle Editor and in the Bundle menus.


See the [UserGuide User Guide] for usage details.
