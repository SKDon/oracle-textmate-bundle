This is a [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) bundle for editing Oracle PL/SQL files, though it may be useful elsewhere, too.

It is based on the bundle created by [Jesper Hvirring Henriksen](http://productive.dk/2006/09/25/oracle-bundle-for-textmate-preview.html).

This bundle does not rely on the standard TextMate "SQL" bundle and includes:

  * A reasonable syntax (which is designed to make it easy to customise for your own needs).
  * Identification of PACKAGE, FUNCTION and PROCEDURE names in the symbol selector in the status bar.
  * Folding of BEGIN, IF and LOOP sections.
  * Indentation which seems to work ok.
  * A number of useful code snippets to help insert BEGIN, IF and LOOP constructs.
  * Templates for package spec and body.
  * Ability to jump to the implementation code of the function or procedure at the cursor if it is in the current project.

There are also a few snippets which I find useful in my coding which add FUNCTION and PROCEDURE stubs, reference to logging function I use and also conditionals based on success or failure of a procedure or function call.  These can easily be customised to fit with your own coding standards.

See the [Installation Guide](InstallationGuide.md) and [User Guide](UserGuide.md) for more information.

There is also a history of [changes](ChangeLog.md) available.
