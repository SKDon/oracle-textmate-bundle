# Installing #

Firstly, download the latest release from the [Downloads page](http://code.google.com/p/oracle-textmate-bundle/downloads/list).  There is a link to this on the main [project page](http://code.google.com/p/oracle-textmate-bundle/), too.

Unzip this file (if you are using Safari, then this will probably have been done for you).

With TextMate installed, you should be able to just double-click on the unzipped bundle and TextMate will move it into your `~/Library/Application Support/TextMate` folder and it will appear in the Bundle Editor and in the Bundle menus.


See the [User Guide](UserGuide.md) for usage details.
